3,"She thinks the personal contact is very helpful and she enjoys it very much, she would do a lot of administrative work, support with language. It could be nice to get along well with the mentee but it's not necessary to become best friends. She thinks mostly organisation, translate things, support with application process.

",,She loves to play soccer. ,
4,"Guiding and accompanying mentees, CV, explain the path and system; she has the expectation that she has the support of SEET and someone she can contact in case of questions & insecurities. ","She would have been very thankful for such support herself. She grew up in Obwalden, she wasa a child with migration background, and had less opportunities than other students who were less talented. She had to fight through the system and nothing is impossible. For her it is very important that they don't give up and follow their dreams.  ",She has experience with foreigners as dental assistant. ,"At the moment she has a lot of time. In May she will again work more, in August she will go to Amsterdam for 6 months. 1-3 hours are always possible. In February 2026 will be back.

There he learned about the diverse challenges people with migrational background in Switzerland. ","He definitely has 1 hour per week.

If someone is completely against his values, then he expresses his opinion and tries to bring arguments. He is able to integrate himself and accept other opinions and views. ","He would first ask whether they really want to do this step. They might be traumatised and has other priorities. They would like to contact us and see if they can get psychological support. They could arrange a physical meeting to work on it together. He could have a conversation about the the rights of a woman to study in Switzerland and the values in Switzerland, but if there is a cultural clash, he cannot overcome the hurdle, or offer more time. ",,He expects that we have offers where they can apply to financial support; otherwise he could maybe also support financially if necessary. He doesn't want to become the person who supports financially regularly. ,,6 May is not possible for him to participate. ,
6,At the beginning she thought it would be more about support on a subject matter level; now she understands more a contact person who has been through the education system and can guide the person and not do everything. ,"She doesn't know about the gymnasium level in Switzerland, but understands the studies level much more. She has contacts who came from non-EU countries and did a degree in Switzerland. ","She has done big travels, but in her working experience whe has always been working with different cultures (India, iran, South America, North America, etc.), she studied in Vienna, lived in Ireland and Zurich.

Then she would try to find the right in-between. I would also try to explore the opinions of our other colleagues and/or our teachers.","I'd ask her first if there is something I could do for her, I'd ask her if she needs psychological help and if yes try to organise that for her. I'd also maybe try to contact SEET in that case. I'd also try to ask her again to produce to document and offer her to sit down together and do it together. If nothing helps i'd contact SEET again and ask what to do. At some point I can't really help my mentee anymore but I'd try of course.","I'd try to find a different solution, I'd google it and try to contact help organisations for this. I'd be encouraging for my mentee because it really is not an easy situation. If nothing works I'd help my mentee to find a new study.","She'd try to find out it has to be this course, she feels like she can find cheaper ones.

8,He has been a mentor in the past; He would like to give back what has been given to him. He would like to support in administrative tasks and translate things. He has been wanting to get involved again in support programs. Mentoring an immigrant in the past has been the most enriching experience for him. ,He has been studying and working in different universities in different countries and it often works similarly. He is used to get information on different websites and he does no shy away from contacting people directly. ,He has been mentoring a sans-papier in the past. ,"He could be flexible, he did 1-3 hours in the past per week. ","He enjoys collaborations and diverse opinions, otherwise you can get stuck in your own mindset and view. He first listens and tries to understand the other opinion and where it comes from and understand how open the person is to communication. Maybe another opinion is better than his so he listens. ",He would offer an ear in case he wants to share what has been going on at home; try to relieve some pressure with dialogue; he can try to give tips on how to reach the goal and taking in account the family situation. He might get more involved if necessary. ,"He would first like to collect the information on why not, understand the situation and decision; he would ask what are the criteria and which ones are not met.

10,"Above all, support with orientation at the university, finding a place to study, regulations, etc., possibly also in contact with the canton or public authorities, possibly with finding accommodation, proofreading documents or letters. Financial support would clearly not be my task.","yes, mainly universities, I would have to find out more about universities of applied sciences.","yes, in a more professional sense, i gave tutoring at the autonomous school in zurich and also worked on the care phone. otherwise, as a binational child, i have had a lot of contact with other cultures and backgrounds. also situations that were not always easy. e.g. regarding residence status. i also live with eight other people from all over the world, although they all come from a similar background and are therefore not so different.","He has one hour per week, whereby he would be happy if the mentee was also somewhat flexible. He currently works 80% and has Friday and the weekend off. He can organize his time freely, as well as Tuesday and Thursday evenings (After 19.00 or if need also 18.00). He would prefer not to have any commitments on Mon and Wed. He is currently only taking two courses at ETH. It's an ambitious semester, but he thinks he can manage it. He has a study period in August 2025, but he thinks 1-2 hours per week is no problem. He can do both online and in person. Basically, he would like to be in person in Zurich. At the end of the interview, he mentioned that he would almost certainly be doing a semester abroad for 4-6 months from Sept/Oct 2025 and would then only be able to communicate with his mentee online and take part in the events ",There are always other opinions. You can also agree to disagree. I think communication and a willingness to compromise are very important there. ,"The most important thing is that the factual situation is clear. In other words, what documents are needed, from which university, who is responsible there and within what deadline can something be sent. what is also needed from the Swiss university? If this is clear, I would try to apply for an extension of the deadline and explain the mentee's situation. I would also ask about the situation if necessary and provide constructive input. Although I would be rather cautious. ","""I would first check the regulations myself, as I have experienced that the study administrations have some freedom in interpreting the rules. Depending on that, I would ask again if needed. There are also websites and federal offices that provide very good information about recognition. Finally, I would look for alternatives with the mentee. Depending on the field of study the person is interested in, there are many options and alternative programs, for example, at a university of applied sciences.""","""If the mentee is determined to attend this course, I would look for alternative funding options. For example, the mentee could take on a part-time job or inquire with a foundation for financial support. I find the price of 3,000 CHF very high, as I was able to take a course at ETH for 80 CHF. That's the other extreme, but there are definitely good, cheaper alternatives, or perhaps a German studies student who could teach the course.""",,"""I generally asked a bit regarding the time commitment, as mentioned in the question above. Basically, I believe that Jau is very busy but would take the mentoring seriously. he would definitely make time for it once a week. Since Jau will be going on a semester abroad in September/October, the mentee should likely be someone who enjoys online contact or is generally a bit more advanced. If someone wants to study electrical engineering, this would definitely be a great match.""","yes, should be ok. 16. October only online, 27. March probably back from semester abroad"
