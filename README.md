SEET provides invaluable mentoring to help refugees enter higher education in Switzerland. Currently,
the process of matching a new mentee with the right volunteer mentor is done manually. This is timeconsuming and limits the program's ability to scale. An effective match is critical for success and depends on complex factors like academic goals, field of study, language skills, and personality.

The challenge is to design a system that automates and enhances this matching process. The goal is to
create a tool that helps SEET administrators make faster, higher-quality matches between refugee
mentees and volunteer mentors, ultimately improving outcomes for the mentees, and making the
program more scalable.
